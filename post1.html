<p>I wish this was under better circumstances.<br>
I’ve been trying to understand how to react to what has happened lately. I can only imagine that you’re under a lot of stress because of things related to me. I’ve been told to stay away from you ig. I don’t mind as long as it makes things easier for you maybe. I’m sorry all this is happening. I’ll make sure I do what’s necessary to cool things down ig.</p>
<p>I’ll be here. Maybe i’ll stay away for as long as possible. I dont want more problems for you. I hope it gets okay.<br>
Yours,</p>
