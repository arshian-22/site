## Happy Birthday Fiza!
I know you're not really a fan of birthdays but to me it's obviously a big deal just like literally anything about you is.

This is something I've been working on for a long time to be honest. You probably don't know about this but, in the limited time when I'm not obsessing over Fiza Orakzai, I'm learning how to become a developer and this website is me really pushing myself past my abilities lol.

I think about how it's not right for us to directly be in live contact so I decided to do something that is not actually contact, but its a little bit of something I'm putting into this world that might make your bad days slightly better....*maybe*

I'll keep on working on this to make it look better and better. I'll also add more stuff that you like so you can always tell me fun things to add and I'll see if I don't ruin the whole thing in the process lol. It's not that fancy but its something ig. *(I stayed up so many nights)* But tbh I also learned alot while making this so it's a win-win situation.

I won't bore you with romantic paragraphs this time. Consider this a gift from bsf Arshian and not the one that gets blocked *occasionally*. 

I have fun with this :>>
