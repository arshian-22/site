Hey lol
This is something I've been working on for a long time to be honest. You probably don't know about this but, in the limited time when I'm not obsessing over Fiza Orakzai, I'm learning how to become a developer and this website is me pushing myself past my abilities lol.
I think about how it's not right for us to directly be in live contact and I always realize that you're obviously right about that aspect of things. So I decided to do something that is not actually contact, but its a little bit of something I'm putting into this world
