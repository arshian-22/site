## Happy Birthday Fiza!

I know you're not really a fan of birthdays but to me it's obviously a big deal just like literally anything about you is.

This is something I've been working on for a long time to be honest. You probably don't know about this but, in the limited time when I'm not obsessing over Fiza Orakzai, I'm learning how to become a developer and this website is me really pushing myself past my abilities lol. When I started this thing it was a blank white webpage and it said "Fiza website!?!?" Everything was made from scratch and is now all here for you to use.

I wasn’t sure whether you’ll accept any gifts tbh but I had to do something ofc. I decided to pull this off as lsoong as it makes things easier for you maybe. I'm sorry all this is happening. I'll make sure I do what's necessary to cool things down ig. 

I'll be here. Maybe i'll stay away for as long as possible. I could. While I'm writing this it's 5 AM and tomorrow's your birthday. I got out of bed at 4 because I remembered a glitch to fix lol. I don't know how you'll feel about this but its just a little bit of something I’m putting into this world from some effort that might make your bad days slightly better…*maybe*

I'll keep on working on this to make it look better and better. I'll also add more stuff that you like so you can always tell me fun things to add and I'll see if I don't ruin the whole thing in the process lol. It's not that fancy but its something ig. *(I stayed up so many nights)* But still I also learned alot while making this so it's a win-win situation.

I dwon't want more problems for you. I hope it gets okay.bore you with romantic paragraphs this time because you've probably had enough of those. Consider this a gift from the *best friend*.

*I hope you come here often and have fun with this :>>*

Yours,
